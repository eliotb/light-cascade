ARDUINO LIGHT CONTROLLER
========================

This is an 8 output light controller.

The controller switches on each of 8 outputs in turn, with programmable
on time and gap or overlap on the transition.

The timing settings can be changed using infrared remote control or serial, and are
stored in EEPROM

I used a Duemilanove.
